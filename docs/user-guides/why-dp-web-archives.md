# Why Digital Preservation and Web Archiving?

## Digital Preservation

Digital preservation is critical for maintaining the accessibility, usability, and integrity of digital information over time. Digital data faces numerous risks, including:

- Hardware and software obsolescence ([learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_obsolescence))
- Media degradation ([learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_degradation))
- Accidental or intentional data loss
- Cyberattacks

As digital content becomes more pervasive, it is essential to safeguard this information for future generations. Without proper preservation efforts, significant historical, cultural, and scientific data may be lost forever.

In addition to its cultural value, digital preservation is vital for legal and regulatory compliance. 

Many organisations are legally obligated to retain certain data for specified periods, and preservation ensures that this information remains accurate and accessible.

## Web Archiving

Web archiving is the process of capturing, preserving, and ensuring continued access to websites and online content over time. As the web evolves rapidly, web archiving has become an essential practice for several reasons:

- **Preserving Cultural Heritage**: Websites reflect and document cultural, societal, and political movements. By archiving online content, we safeguard this valuable aspect of our cultural history.
  
- **Supporting Historical Research**: The web serves as a primary resource for understanding historical events, social changes, and shifting public attitudes. Archived websites provide an invaluable window into the past.
  
- **Ensuring Legal and Regulatory Compliance**: Many organisations are legally required to archive specific online content, such as government websites, to meet regulatory requirements.
  
- **Protecting Business Continuity**: Archiving corporate websites and social media ensures that important digital assets are not lost, helping businesses maintain continuity and access to key information.
  
- **Promoting Accountability and Transparency**: By preserving government, corporate, and public online content, web archiving helps ensure transparency and accountability in digital public discourse.
