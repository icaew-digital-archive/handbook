## What is Digital Preservation?

Digital preservation is the practice of maintaining the accessibility, usability, and integrity of digital information over time. It involves strategies and processes to ensure that digital content remains accessible and usable despite technological changes, media degradation, and other risks.

**Digital data faces numerous risks, including:**

- Hardware and software obsolescence ([learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_obsolescence))
- Media degradation ([learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_degradation))
- Accidental or intentional data loss
- Cyberattacks

As digital content becomes more pervasive, it is essential to safeguard this information for future generations. Without proper preservation efforts, significant historical, cultural, and scientific data may be lost forever.
