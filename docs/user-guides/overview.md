# Overview of the ICAEW Digital Archive

> **Purpose:** The ICAEW Digital Archive consists of two main components: a **digital preservation platform** ([Preservica](https://icaew.access.preservica.com/)) and **web archive collections** (hosted on both [Preservica](https://icaew.access.preservica.com/) and [Archive-It](https://archive-it.org/organizations/1613)).

## Preservica

Preservica is a cloud-based digital preservation platform used globally by organisations to manage and preserve digital content for the long term. It provides tools for ingest, storage, metadata management, preservation planning, and access, ensuring the ongoing availability, authenticity, and usability of digital content across changing hardware, software, and file formats.

**Key capabilities:**

- Supports a wide range of content types: documents, images, audio, video, and web content
- Preserves assets throughout their lifecycle
- Provides robust search and retrieval functionality
- Ensures long-term accessibility despite technological changes

### How ICAEW Uses Preservica

ICAEW primarily uses Preservica for preserving:

- **Documents**: PDFs, DOCs, and other document formats
- **Images**: Photographs, graphics, and visual materials
- **Audio**: Podcasts and other audio recordings
- **Video**: Webinars, YouTube content, and video materials
- **Web Collections**: Some web archive collections are hosted in Preservica

**Key characteristics:**
- Content is _curated_ and organised into a hierarchical folder structure
- Detailed metadata supports search and retrieval
- Structured organization makes content easier to navigate

> **Note:** Logged-in captures of ICAEW.com can be found in Preservica but not on Archive-It.

## Web Archive Collections

A web archive is a collection of preserved web pages and digital content, enabling access to historical versions of websites. Web archiving involves capturing web pages and associated metadata (e.g., URLs, timestamps, file formats) using specialised software to ensure long-term availability and accessibility.

**Hosting platforms:**

- [Preservica](https://icaew.access.preservica.com/) - Some web collections
- [Archive-It](https://archive-it.org/organizations/1613) - Primary web archiving platform

### How ICAEW Uses Web Archives

ICAEW primarily uses web archiving to periodically capture websites, most notably ICAEW.com.

**Key characteristics:**

- Web archives are _not curated_—they lack detailed metadata to aid search
- Content is captured as it appears on the web at specific points in time
- Navigation can be more challenging compared to curated Preservica content
- Provides historical snapshots of websites and online content
